# GetETHAddressandBalance
Click one button and display ETH main address (Account 1) and ETH balance

This is a follow up to an earlier homework - view here.

The earlier homework, although the code enables to view the balances of all the tokens along with the main account, I would still have to input the main account address.
Here, this code extracts the main account address for me. It is then able to use the account address to extract the balance as well (later part of the code running at the one click of the button)

We do not see any form of confirmation for any gas payment when this code runs.

My lecturer says any transaction done has to pay gas, even view balance.... sigh....
